# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

**Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock** is a advanced version of the Rock Paper Scissors game that I have decided to make with HTML, CSS and Javascript. You have 5 choices and 5 rounds to win the game. The game is one player and you must beat the computer to win.

## Bugs

| Bug | Solution |
| :---| :---|
|I used If/else statements for the game logic checkWinner() the game kept giving a draw at random. | I used a Switch statement instead to solve this problem.|
| The winning streak was going up in doubles after playing again. | I was calling playgame() inside newGame() that was causing this issue.
| I had a footer that would not stretch across the page and stayat the bottom. | After two days of trying to sort it I decided to remove the footer. |

## Existing Bugs

I have one rare bug that has pops up sometimes and I was not able to locate it. When you click scissors on your very first go the computer does not pick there choice but after the game works as normal.

# Credits

## Code Used

Before starting my project I read [7 ways to code Rock Paper Scissors](https://betterprogramming.pub/7-ways-to-code-rock-paper-scissors-in-javascript-4189a5e7e535) when using a `If else statement` for the game logic it was giving too many bugs so I came back to this article to see how else I could do it.

When I was first deciding what to make for project 2 I was watching coding videos on youtube and came across [Bro Code video of Rock Paper Scissors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1_vHArDBRA&t=305s). I familiarised myself with his code and learnt how to make the function computer turn. I would like to reference/credit this piece of code.

## Media

I got the image in the first container from [The Big Bang Theory Fandom](https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Rock,_Paper,_Scissors,_Lizard,_Spock).

I got the image in the end game container from [Chasing The Frog](http://www.chasingthefrog.com/item/rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock-t-shirt/).
