# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

**Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock** is a advanced version of the Rock Paper Scissors game that I have decided to make with HTML, CSS and Javascript. You have 5 choices and 5 rounds to win the game. The game is one player and you must beat the computer to win.

## Bugs

| Bug | Solution |
| :---| :---|
|I used If/else statements for the game logic checkWinner() the game kept giving a draw at random | I used a Switch statement instead to solve this problem.|
| The winning streak was going up in doubles after playing again. | I was calling playgame() inside newGame() that was causing this issue.
| I had a footer that would not stay down across the page | After two days of trying to sort it I decided to remove the footer |
